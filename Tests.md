# Unit Tests vs Integration Tests

## Unit Test:
A unit test is a type of software test that focuses on testing individual units or components in isolation. A "unit" typically refers to the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system, such as a function, method, or class.

### Key Characteristics of Unit Tests:
- **Isolated**: Unit tests should test only the logic of the specific unit (e.g., a single method) without interacting with external dependencies like databases, files, APIs, etc.
- **Fast**: Since they do not rely on external systems, unit tests are quick to run and can be executed frequently.
- **Repeatable**: Unit tests should produce the same results every time, regardless of the environment.
- **Use of Mocks/Stubs**: External dependencies (e.g., databases, services) are usually mocked or stubbed out to keep the unit under test isolated.

## Integration Test:
An integration test is a type of software test that checks the interaction between different units or components in a system. Unlike unit tests, integration tests assess how multiple parts of the system work together, often including external systems like databases, APIs, and file systems.

### Key Characteristics of Integration Tests:
- **Tests Multiple Components**: Integration tests check if different parts of the system (e.g., services, repositories, and databases) work correctly when integrated.
- **Involves External Resources**: These tests typically interact with external dependencies, such as databases, file systems, third-party services, or networks.
- **Slower**: Because they involve setting up and interacting with external systems, integration tests are generally slower than unit tests.
- **More Complex Setup**: Integration tests often require additional setup (e.g., creating database tables, seeding data) and teardown to ensure a consistent test environment.
